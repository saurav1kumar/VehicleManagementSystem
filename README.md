# VehicleManagementSystem
This API fetches details of vehicles in a sorted manner based on their price, and if two vehicles have the same price, it sorts them based on their color in alphabetical order. Additionally, it allows users to filter the results to only show vehicles with a price greater than or equal to a specified value.
